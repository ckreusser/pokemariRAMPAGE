# Pokemari RAMPAGE

## Why Make This Game?
Pokemari RAMPAGE answers the question of, ‘what you should do after escaping the clutches of your evil masters…’ Rampage! I wanted to create a game where you control a Pokemon who grows by consuming the blood of your enemies. The concept is a mashup with another Japanese game, Katamari.

I used a quote generator API to generate words of wisdom before, during, and after embarking on your quest for vengeance. The ‘RAMPAGE Inspiration’ button will produce a relevant (or irrelevant) inspirational quote.

## Features:
- Move Pikachu towards revenge
- Cackle as your enemies flee with terror
- Grow to monstrous proportions
- Achieve Colossal Conquest

Take control of an angry Pika hell-bent on revenge.

Wipe out hoards of multiverse trainers in their hunt for their former “pet.”

They’re about to find out that the line between Pocket Monster and Man is much thinner than they planned…

Consume magical trainer blood to grow to outrageous proportions!
